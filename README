This corresponds to the GUI part of our project. 

To test the physics part of our project: 
	- go into the Physics/ folder
	- run make test
	- launch ./test[]
	
	you can specify wich test you want by adding arguments :
	
	v	./test libvector.c

	f	./test force.c

	p	./test physic.c

	c	./test collision.c

	some will be added in the futur

	when no argmuent is given, test will consider all arguments.
